> **Vibecoded Disclaimer:** This custom node is 100% vibecoded. The author does not know how to code. This entire repository was built by prompting LLMs. If something breaks, please copy the `klein_tiled_upscaler.py` file along with your console logs, feed them into an LLM (like Claude or GPT), and ask it to help you fix it. But it would be helpful if you share your findings. Also perhaps you know how to code and found an obvious way to improve this node that I have no idea about, you can share it so I can later go ask Gemini to implement it.

## 🤖 Prompting
This section outlines the ideas for prompt structures.

### Realistic Images Prompt
```text
upscale image, subtle material texture, natural surface complexity, natural proportions, coherent structure, clean form, photographic fidelity
```

### Illustrations Prompt
```text
upscale illustration, subtle texture, natural surface complexity, coherent structure, preserve original art style
```

### Prompting Strategy
* **💡 Tip:** Keep prompts focused on the overall material and details of the scene.
* **Avoid:** Complex prompts describing specific objects in one corner to prevent hallucinations in other tiles.
* **Smooth Skin:** Depending  on the prompt it can increase texture on the skin where it's actually supposed to be smooth. 
* **Extreme upscale factor:** If pushed too far the model receives too little context to make sense of the tile and how to steer it content.

## 🎯 Regional Prompting via Masks

Scope prompts to specific masked regions of the image so that each tile only receives the prompts that actually own part of it. This mitigates the two classic tiled-upscaling failure modes:

| Issue | Without Regional Prompting | With Regional Prompting |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Hallucinations** | Empty sky gets random objects rendered because the prompt describes the whole scene | Sky tiles never see unrelated prompts — only the sky mask's prompt (or the base prompt) |
| **Prompt Bleed** | "Detailed pores on skin" adds pores to clothing, background, everything | The skin prompt is masked to the skin region; other regions use their own prompts or the base prompt |

### How It Works

For each tile processed:
1. Region masks (any input resolution) are rescaled once to canvas space, then cropped to the tile's actual sampled area (core + padding, after 32-px alignment) — so the regional conditioning is pixel-exact with what the sampler sees.
2. Masks with negligible ownership of the tile (< 0.1% coverage) are dropped for that tile — no wasted model evaluations, no cross-tile bleed.
3. Each remaining mask is attached to its pre-encoded prompt conditioning (prompts are CLIP-encoded once upfront, not per tile). ComfyUI rescales the attached masks to latent resolution at sampling start.
4. The base positive prompt is appended unmasked as the fallback for areas not covered by any mask, and the combined conditioning is passed to the sampler. Per-tile reference latents are applied to all entries as usual.

### New Inputs

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `clip` | CLIP | Optional | CLIP encoder used to encode the per-mask prompt strings. |
| `masks` | MASK | Optional | Batched masks `[N, H, W]`, one per region, at any resolution (automatically rescaled to canvas size). |
| `prompts_json` | STRING | Optional | JSON array of prompt strings, one per mask, in mask batch order. Example: `["face detail, sharp eyes", "fabric texture, woven pattern"]` |

**All three must be connected together.** If any is missing or malformed (invalid JSON, prompt count ≠ mask count), regional prompting is disabled with a console warning and the node behaves exactly as before — existing workflows are unaffected.

### Usage Example

```
CLIP (from Checkpoint/Loader) ─────────► clip
                                          │
Mask (face region) ───┐                  │
                       ▼                  ▼
                   Mask Batch ──► masks ─ Klein Tiled Upscaler
                       ▲                  ▲
Mask (clothing) ──────┘                  │
                                          │
prompts_json: ["portrait face, sharp eyes, skin detail",
               "woven fabric, textile texture, cloth weave"]
```

### Tips

* **Base prompt:** Always provide a sensible base positive prompt — unmasked areas fall back to it, and it also blends with the regional prompts inside masked areas for global coherence.
* **Overlapping masks:** Allowed — overlap areas receive combined conditioning from all overlapping prompts.
* **Keep regional prompts material-focused:** Same rule as the base prompt — describe texture/material, not new objects.
* **Performance:** Prompts are encoded once upfront; per tile, only the masks that own part of that tile add conditioning entries, so overhead scales with actual mask coverage, not mask count.

## 🎯 Why An Inpainting-Based Tile Upscaler?

Unlike purely mathematical patch-mixers, this node runs a sequential, single-pass **inpainting pipeline** on a tiled grid. It is designed specifically for **creative upscaling**—where you don't just want to sharpen existing pixels, but rather want the AI to imagine rich, coherent new high-frequency details (organic textures, surface imperfections, realistic grain) within each tile. It also vram friendly. 

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Symmetrical Canvas Partitioning (`Auto` Mode)
Traditional tilers often leave an odd-sized, smaller partial tile at the right and bottom edges of the image, causing poor boundary integration. 
* **Auto Slicing:** Dynamically divides your canvas into perfectly identical, equal-sized tiles near your target size. 
* For example, a $3584 \times 2784$ canvas is partitioned into exactly four equal $896$-pixel columns and three equal $928$-pixel rows. Symmetrical tile dimensions result in completely uniform structural generations.

### 2. Built-In Reference Latents
Symmetrical reference latent extraction, model patching, and structural guidance are handled natively inside the node's execution pipeline.

### 3. Ground-Truth Laplacian Detail Analysis
Instead of basic pixel variance (which is easily tricked by smooth sky gradients), this node runs a GPU-accelerated $3\times3$ Laplacian edge convolution over the grayscale representation of your **original low-resolution input image**:
* **No Bicubic Noise Inflation:** Bypasses the high-frequency ringing and overshoots created by bicubic upscaling.
* **3x3 Pre-Convolution Blur:** Smooths out microscopic sensor noise and JPEG compression artifacts before analysis. 
* **The Result:** The node correctly differentiates between flat sky/walls (which drop smoothly to 2 steps) and detailed elements (which run at 4 steps), preventing flat areas from generating unwanted "hallucinations".

### 4. Symmetrical Crop Sizes
Even when edge tiles are positioned near boundaries, pass-through parameters force every single crop passed to the VAE Encoder to remain **100% identical in size**. This completely eliminates shape-mismatch artifacts during latent processing.

### 5. VRAM-Friendly Architecture
Because this node processes the canvas sequentially tile-by-tile instead of merging massive global attention maps or holding multiple high-resolution noise layers in memory simultaneously, its VRAM footprint remains low. This allows you to generate massive, high-fidelity upscales even on budget GPUs.

### 6. LoRa's support
All loras for Flux2.Klein should work as expected. Including loras for upscaling, consistency, style.

## 🛑 Limitations & Testing Configuration

* **Prompt Sensitivity:** Highly descriptive or structurally-mismatching prompts can cause stylistic tile drift. Keep prompts focused on the overall material and details of the scene. A basic prompt like `"upscale this image"` works fine, whereas a complex prompt describing specific objects in one corner can cause those objects to hallucinate in other tiles. **Mitigation:** Use [Regional Prompting via Masks](#-regional-prompting-via-masks) to scope specific prompts to specific regions.
* **Development Disclaimer:** For development and debugging reasons, the vast majority of tests and calibrations were made with a basic, fast configuration: **4 steps, Euler sampler, CFG 1.0 (Guidance 1.0), 1024 tile size, and 2x upscale**. If you go outside these values (e.g. running 20+ steps, higher CFG/guidance models, or extreme upscales), you may encounter unexpected rendering behaviors, contrast shifts, or alignment quirks that I have not accounted for.

## 🔄 Comparison With Other Methods

* **Standard Hi-Res Fix (Latent Upscale):** Upscales the entire latent space at once. While visually coherent, it can causes Out-of-Memory (OOM) crashes on high target resolutions.
* **Ultimate SD Upscale:** Runs sequential pixel-space blending. It frequently struggles with tile boundaries, grid seams.
* **SDXL Tile ControlNet Upscalers:** Relies on a ControlNet Tile model to guide boundaries. ControlNet Tile models do not exist natively or performantly for Flux2.Klein.
* **SeedVR2 Upscaler:** While SeedVR2 produces incredible blur removal, it is exceptionally computationally heavy, slow to run, and highly VRAM-intensive. Klein Tiled Upscaler runs fast with moderate VRAM usage. But if you want you can use it with this node, just use 1x upscale and connect the image that was upscaled with SeedVR.

## 🛠️ Parameter Settings Guide

* **`tile_size_mode` (Auto / Manual):** 
  * `Auto` (recommended): Automatically calculates equal, perfectly symmetrical tile boundaries.
  * `Manual`: Allows you to set custom `tile_width` and `tile_height` values.
* **`tiling_strategy` (Detail-First / Spiral / Chess / Linear):**
  * `Detail-First`: Analyzes the scene and processes the highly textured tiles first. Flat zones (skies, walls) are processed last, allowing them to anchor cleanly to the finalized, sharp boundaries of the foreground details.
* **`color_match` (True / False):**
  * Performs linear histogram matching of each tile against the original upscaled canvas. This should eliminate visible blocky lighting variations, contrast drifts, or color blocks across seams. Doesn't replace other color match solutions, you might still want to use them in your pipeline. 
* **`adaptive_tiling` (True / False):**
  * Dynamically reduces denoiser steps in low-detail zones (skies/walls) to save render time. Flat skies/walls scale down to 50% steps (2 steps), while detailed zones keep 100% steps (4 steps).
* **`skip_threshold` (True / False):** NEW. Skip tiles with set variance entirely. Which allows denoised tiles to anchor to them as a "ground truth" content. As a consequence also improves speed. Recommended to use with adaptive_tiling on since surrounded tiles will be run with lower denoise, reducing possible difference between tiles. Only works with Detail-First `tiling_strategy`. Values of variance depend on the image, consult with logs if unsure what to set. 
* **`core_anchor` :**
  * Use it to control "creativity" of upscale. The lower the value the less details get added. I prefer to have it at 1.0 on most images. At 0.85 it is already very subtle.  
* **`consistent_noise` :**
  * NEW. Sample all tiles from one shared full-canvas noise field. Greatly improved coherence of lightning, shadows, reflections across given scene. But also tends to be more creative witch can give unwonted effects. Still experimenting with it. The results so far have been hit or miss.   


* **`Upscaler model input` :** Optional, runs bicubic without it. 
* **`clip` / `masks` / `prompts_json` :** Optional, all three together enable [Regional Prompting via Masks](#-regional-prompting-via-masks). `masks` is a batched MASK `[N, H, W]` (any resolution); `prompts_json` is a JSON array of prompt strings in mask batch order, e.g. `["face detail", "fabric texture"]`. If any is missing or invalid, regional prompting is disabled with a console warning and the node behaves as before.
* **`LATENT output` :** Only ever useful in 2 stage workflow. Tiles latent get blended with nearby tiles.  Don't recommended to use it with `Vae decode/Vae decode tiled` nodes. The node already decodes each tile as the process goes.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting & Visible Seams

If you see visible grid lines, tile boxes, or color transitions in your output, go through this checklist:
1. **Enable Color Match:** Ensure `color_match` is set to `True`. This locks the luminance and contrast of the tiles to the original reference.
2. **Increase Mask Blur:** Increase `mask_blur` to `48` or `64`. This softens the physical crossfade mask boundaries.
3. **Use Detail-First Strategy:** Set your `tiling_strategy` to `Detail-First`. This forces the generator to build sharp foreground structures first, establishing anchor points for skies and walls to blend into later.
4. **Turn Off/On Adaptive Tiling:** In my test it helps with eliminating some visible difference between tiles. But the sudden shift in steps (e.g. 4 steps vs 2 steps) can occasionally cause minor contrast transitions on difficult images. Turning it `False` forces all tiles to run at uniform step counts, guaranteeing perfect rendering consistency.Also this mode can introduce visible noise that wasn't denoized by the model.
5. **Consitency loras:** You can use loras for consistency, they will work as expected. But will limit the upscaler strength. Also some upscaler/fix details loras for Flux2.Klein have some consistency capabilities built in, so you can try them. If you do you should probably increase the steps, at 4 steps the effect was very minor.
6. **core_anchor:** Reduce value until issue is resolved. 

**Known bugs:** Sometimes, with a specifically 3x upscale factor, the model begins to heavily hallucinate and lose any context of reference latent. I could not find the exact reason why. Some images work fine, some don't at all. One thing I discovered is that it is happening with the q8 model but doesn't with the INT8 model.
